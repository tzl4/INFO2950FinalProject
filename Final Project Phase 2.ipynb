    "Every year, there are over 85 million taxi rides in New York City, crisscrossing the city with distinctive yellow cabs. Our project seeks to explore the key factors correlated with taxi ridership in NYC. We drew on and combined two sources of data:\n",
    "1. Detailed trip-level data on daily NYC taxi ridership from January to August 2019, obtained from the New York City Taxi and Limousine creation website (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The data came in the form of 8 monthly datasets of yellow taxi ridership, each of a large size (7+ million observations, 700+ MB)\n",

    "Certain attributes (such as `Fare_amount`, `PULocationID` and `trip_distance`) are useful as they help TLC assess the health and profitability of the industry it is regulating. TLC may act on those attributes to draft new policies (e.g. enforcing the fare rate in taxis, buying taxi models that are more fuel-efficient for short trips). On the other hand, an attribute like \"\n",

While the significance of knowing whether a trip record was held in vehicle memory is unclear, the ease of measuring this attribute with taxi sensors likely led to its inclusion in the taxi dataset. The lack of measurability is also why certain useful attributes (such as \"satisfaction rate of customers\" or \"fatigue level of drivers\") are not included in the dataset&mdash;they are simply not measurable with current sensors in taxis.\n",

Due to this focus on comparability, the attributes observed (e.g. `maxtemp`, `mintemp`, `precipitation`) are very standard across weather stations in the US, and they are measured in standard units (e.g. F, inches). \n",
